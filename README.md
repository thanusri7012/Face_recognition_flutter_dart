# 📸 Efficient Attendance Tracking Using On-Spot Facial Recognition System

## 📌 Project Description  
The **Efficient Attendance Tracking Using On-Spot Facial Recognition System** is a mobile-based solution that automates attendance using **real-time facial recognition**.  
Built with **Flutter**, **TensorFlow**, **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Deep Learning**, and **Firebase**, the system ensures **high accuracy**, **secure data storage**, and **seamless operation**.  
It works **offline** to handle connectivity issues, sends **instant notifications**, and prevents **proxy attendance** by validating each individual on the spot.

## 🚀 Key Features  

### 🎯 On-Spot Facial Recognition  
- **Real-time Face Detection & Recognition** using TensorFlow-based deep learning models.  
- **High Accuracy** even in varied lighting and environmental conditions.  
- **Offline Functionality** with automatic data sync when internet is restored.  

### 🔔 Instant Notifications  
- **Immediate Alerts** sent to students and administrators after attendance is recorded.  
- **Customizable Notification Settings** for different user roles.  

### ☁ Secure Cloud Storage  
- **Firebase Integration** for encrypted, real-time data storage.  
- **Data Sync** between offline and online modes for uninterrupted tracking.  

### 📊 Attendance Management  
- **Automated Reports** with daily, weekly, and monthly summaries.  
- **Proxy Prevention** through one-to-one face verification at the time of entry.

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
**Frontend (Mobile App):**  
- Flutter (cross-platform UI)  

**Backend:**  
- Python with FastAPI (REST API)  
- TensorFlow (facial recognition model)  

**Database & Cloud:**  
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage)  

**AI & ML:**  
- Deep Learning models for face detection and recognition

## ⚙ How It Works  
1. **Face Enrollment** → Users register their face data securely in the app.  
2. **Attendance Capture** → Camera scans the face and matches it with stored embeddings.  
3. **Verification & Logging** → If matched, attendance is marked instantly.  
4. **Notifications & Reports** → Alerts are sent, and data is stored in Firebase for reporting.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This project demonstrates how **AI-powered facial recognition** can modernize attendance systems, making them **faster, more reliable, and secure**, while also preventing manual errors and fraudulent entries.
